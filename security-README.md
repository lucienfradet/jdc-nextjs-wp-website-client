# Form Security and Field Sanitization Implementation

This document provides an overview of the form security and field sanitization implementation for Le Jardin des Chefs website.

## Overview

The implementation includes a comprehensive approach to form security with:

1. **Client-side validation** using React Hook Form with Yup schemas
2. **Field sanitization** on both client and server sides
3. **CSRF protection** for all form submissions
4. **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse
5. **Server-side validation** of all input data

## Implementation Components

### Client-Side Libraries

- **React Hook Form**: For form state management and validation
- **Yup**: For schema validation
- **DOMPurify**: For HTML sanitization

### Server-Side Security

- **Input Sanitization**: All incoming data is sanitized
- **Validation**: Field-specific validation rules
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based protection for forms
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse

## File Structure

### Validation Utilities

- `lib/validation.js`: Client-side validation utilities
- `lib/serverSanitizers.js`: Server-side sanitization utilities
- `lib/validationSchemas.js`: Yup schemas for form validation

### Middleware

- `lib/apiMiddleware.js`: API middleware for sanitization
- `lib/csrf-server.js`: CSRF protection middleware
- `lib/rateLimiter.js`: Rate limiting middleware

### Form Components

- `components/NewsletterForm.jsx`: Newsletter subscription form
- `components/checkout/CheckoutForm.jsx`: Checkout form
- `components/checkout/StripePaymentForm.jsx`: Payment form

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization

- **Validate on both client and server**: Never trust client-side validation alone
- **Sanitize all inputs**: Remove any potentially dangerous content
- **Use type-specific validation**: Email, phone, postal code all have specific formats

### 2. CSRF Protection

- Token-based CSRF protection for all forms
- Tokens are time-limited and one-time use
- Tokens are verified on the server side

### 3. Rate Limiting

- Different rate limits for different types of requests
- Protection against brute force and DoS attacks

### 4. Server-side Security

- All API endpoints implement proper validation
- Sanitization middleware for consistent handling
- Secure response headers

## User Data Handling

- User data is sanitized before storage
- Only collect necessary data
- Clear validation error messages
- Consistent error handling

## Additional Security Considerations

1. **Always Keep Dependencies Updated**
   - Regularly update npm packages to patch security vulnerabilities

2. **Enable Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   - Consider implementing CSP headers to restrict resource loading

3. **Implement Security Headers**
   - X-Content-Type-Options
   - X-Frame-Options
   - Strict-Transport-Security

4. **Database Query Protection**
   - Using Prisma ORM provides protection against SQL injection

5. **Monitor and Log Security Events**
   - Implement logging for security-related events
   - Regularly review logs for suspicious activity

## Testing Security

1. **Penetration Testing**
   - Regularly test for common vulnerabilities
   - Consider automated security scanning

2. **Validation Testing**
   - Test form validation with edge cases
   - Test with malicious input patterns

3. **Attack Simulation**
   - Test CSRF protection
   - Test rate limiting effectiveness

## Maintenance Recommendations

1. Regular security audits
2. Keep all dependencies updated
3. Monitor server logs for suspicious activity
4. Stay informed about new vulnerabilities and attack vectors
